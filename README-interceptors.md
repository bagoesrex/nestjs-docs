## Interceptors

An interceptor is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator and implements the `NestInterceptor` interface.

Interceptors have a set of useful capabilities which are inspired by the **Aspect Oriented Programming** (AOP) technique. They make it possible to:

- bind extra logic before / after method execution
- transform the result returned from a function
- transform the exception thrown from a function
- extend the basic function behavior
- completely override a function depending on specific conditions (e.g., for caching purposes)

## Basics

Each interceptor implements the `intercept()` method, which takes two arguments. The first one is the `ExecutionContext` instance (exactly the same object as for **guards**). The `ExecutionContext` inherits from `ArgumentsHost`. We saw `ArgumentsHost` before in the exception filters chapter. There, we saw that it's a wrapper around arguments that have been passed to the original handler, and contains different arguments arrays based on the type of the application. You can refer back to the **exception filters** for more on this topic.

## Execution context

By extending `ArgumentsHost`, `ExecutionContext` also adds several new helper methods that provide additional details about the current execution process. These details can be helpful in building more generic interceptors that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts.

## Call Handler

The second argument is a `CallHandler`. The `CallHandler` interface implements the `handle()` method, which you can use to invoke the route handler method at some point in your interceptor. If you don't call the `handle()` method in your implementation of the `intercept()` method, the route handler method won't be executed at all.

This approach means that the `intercept()` method effectively wraps the request/response stream. As a result, you may implement custom logic **both before and after** the execution of the final route handler. It's clear that you can write code in your `intercept()` method that executes **before** calling `handle()`, but how do you affect what happens afterward? Because the `handle()` method returns an `Observable`, we can use powerful [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) operators to further manipulate the response. Using Aspect Oriented Programming terminology, the invocation of the route handler (i.e., calling `handle()`) is called a [Pointcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointcut), indicating that it's the point at which our additional logic is inserted.

Consider, for example, an incoming `POST /keonks` request. This request is destined for the `create()` handler defined inside the `KeonksController`. If an interceptor which does not call the `handle()` method is called anywhere along the way, the `create()` method won't be executed. Once `handle()` is called (and its `Observable` has been returned), the `create()` handler will be triggered. And once the response stream is received via the `Observable`, additional operations can be performed on the stream, and a final result returned to the caller.

## Aspect interception

The first use case we'll look at is to use an interceptor to log user interaction (e.g., storing user calls, asynchronously dispatching events or calculating a timestamp). We show a simple `LoggingInterceptor` below:

```ts
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    console.log('Before...');

    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        tap(() => console.log(`After... ${Date.now() - now}ms`)),
      );
  }
}
```

> **Hint**
> The `NestInterceptor<T, R>` is a generic interface in which `T` indicates the type of an `Observable<T>` (supporting the response stream), and `R` is the type of the value wrapped by `Observable<R>`.

> **Notice**
> Interceptors, like controllers, providers, guards, and so on, can **inject dependencies** through their `constructor`.

Since `handle()` returns an RxJS `Observable`, we have a wide choice of operators we can use to manipulate the stream. In the example above, we used the `tap()` operator, which invokes our anonymous logging function upon graceful or exceptional termination of the observable stream, but doesn't otherwise interfere with the response cycle.
