## Middleware

Middleware is a function which is called **before** the route handler. Middleware functions have access to the **request** and **response** objects, and the `next()` middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The **next** middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Nest middleware are, by default, equivalent to **express** middleware. The following description from the official express documentation describes the capabilities of middleware:

> Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
>
> - execute any code.
> - make changes to the request and the response objects.
> - end the request-response cycle.
> - call the next middleware function in the stack.
> - if the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

You implement custom Nest middleware in either a function, or in a class with an `@Injectable()` decorator. The class should implement the `NestMiddleware` interface, while the function does not have any special requirements. Let's start by implementing a simple middleware feature using the class method.

> **Warning**
> `Express` and `fastify` handle middleware differently and provide different method signatures.

```ts
logger.middleware.ts;

import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    console.log('Request...');
    next();
  }
}
```

## Dependency injection

Nest middleware fully supports Dependency Injection. Just as with providers and controllers, they are able to inject dependencies that are available within the same module. As usual, this is done through the `constructor`.
