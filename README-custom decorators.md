## Custom route decorators

Nest is built around a language feature called **decorators**. Decorators are a well-known concept in a lot of commonly used programming languages, but in the JavaScript world, they're still relatively new.

> An ES2016 decorator is an expression which returns a function and can take a target, name and property descriptor as arguments. You apply it by prefixing the decorator with an `@` character and placing this at the very top of what you are trying to decorate. Decorators can be defined for either a class, a method or a property.
